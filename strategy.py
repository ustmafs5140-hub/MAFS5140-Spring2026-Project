STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. This Strategy class is where you will implement your own trading strategy.
2. The current implementation is just a SIMPLE EXAMPLE (Mean Reversion) 
   provided for your reference. Please modify this class to build your own strategy.
3. You may create new Python scripts and import them into this file if you 
   want to organize your code. 
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify any other existing scripts in the backtest 
   framework. Changing core engine files may break the backtester and cause 
   evaluation errors.

        Initialize any state variables here.
        This function is called exactly once at the very beginning of the backtest.
        
        GUIDANCE:
        - You can create state variables using 'self.' to store data across steps.
        - For example, you might want to store historical market data, indicators, 
          or previous portfolio allocations.
        - PERFORMANCE WARNING: Storing too much historical data in memory (e.g., 
          growing a list infinitely) can significantly slow down the backtest or 
          cause memory crashes. Always try to keep only the data you need.
